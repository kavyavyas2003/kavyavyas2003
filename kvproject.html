            Rajasthan and the centre of the eponymous Ajmer District. It is located at the centre of Rajasthan. It is
            also known as heart of Rajasthan.[citation needed] The city was established as "Ajayameru" (translated as
            "Invincible Hills") by a Chahamana ruler, either Ajayaraja I or Ajayaraja II, and served as their capital
            until the 12th century CE.<img src="aj.jpg" alt="blank" width="285px" height="105px"></div>

    <h2><u><b>#FAMOUS FORTS OF RAJASTHAN.........</b></u></h2>
    <div class="ll" id="11">
        <h2>#1:-AMBER FORT(JAIPUR):-</h2>
        <p>Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 square
            kilometres (1.5 sq mi)located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amer
            and the Amber Fort were originally built by Raja Man Singh and additions were, later, made by Sawai Jai
            Singh. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. Amer Fort is known
            for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort
            overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.

            Mughal architecture greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings of the fort.Constructed
            of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a
            courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of
            Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate
            is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is
            also popularly known as the Amer Palace. The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their
            families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila
            Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of
            Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made
            12 rooms, one for each Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but the Queens were not
            to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.

        <h2>#2:-CITY PALACE(JAIPUR):-</h2>
        <p>
            The City Palace, Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh
            II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Jaipur is the present-day capital of the state of
            Rajasthan, and until 1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of
            Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts,
            commerce, and industry. It now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues to be the home
            of the Jaipur royal family.[citation needed] The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards,
            galleries, restaurants, and offices of the Museum Trust.The MSMS II Museum Trust is headed by chairperson
            Rajamata Padmini Devi of Jaipur (from Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh). Princess Diya Kumari runs the Museum
            Trust, as its secretary and trustee. She also manages The Palace School and Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh
            School in Jaipur. She founded and runs the Princess Diya Kumari Foundation to empower underprivileged and
            underemployed women of Rajasthan. She is also an entrepreneur. In 2013, she was elected as Member of the
            Legislative Assembly of Rajasthan from the constituency of Sawai Madhopur.

        <h2>#3:-HAWA MAHAL(JAIPUR):-</h2>
        <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, the palace sits
            on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

            The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
            Singh, who was the founder of the city of Jaipur, India. He was so inspired by the unique structure the
            of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

            It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small
            windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design
            was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without
            being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them to appear in public
            without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass
            through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.Many
            people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the
            back.

            In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the
            monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million. The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the
            historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it. The
            palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched roofs
            are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modelled hanging
            cornices.</p>

        <h2>#4:-NAHARGARH FORT(JAIPUR):-</h2>
        <p>Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state
            of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the
            city. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of
            tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia,whose spirit haunted the
            place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his
            memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai
            Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above
            the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to
            Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the course
            of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred
            with Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including
            the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their
            protection.</p>

        <img src="nf.jpg" alt="blank" width="650px" height="300px">

        <p class="kav">The ticket for the historical fort of Nahargarh costs ₹50 for Indian nationals. For foreign
            tourists, the cost goes up to ₹200 (US$2.60). Students enjoy discounted prices. For foreign students, the
            ticket costs ₹50 (66¢ US), and ₹25 for Indian students.

            Nahargarh fort is open from 10 a.m. and the gates of the fort closes in the evening at 05.30 p.m. The
            visitors are not advised to stay any later than that because the fort is surrounded by dense deciduous
            forest. The forest is part of Nahargarh Biological Park and home to many wild animals.</p>

        <h2>#5:-JAISALMER FORT:-</h2>
        <p>
            Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is believed to be
            one of the very few "living forts" in the world (such as Carcassonne, France), as nearly one fourth of the
            old city's population still resides within the fort. For the better part of its 800-year history, the fort
            was the city of Jaisalmer. The first settlements outside the fort walls, to accommodate the growing
            population of Jaisalmer, are said to have come up in the 17th century.

            Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rajput[2] Rawal (ruler)
            Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at the crossroads of important trade routes (including the
            ancient Silk road).

            The fort's massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion colour during the day, fading to honey-gold as
            the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. For this reason it is also known as the
            Sonar Quila or Golden Fort. The fort stands amidst the sandy expanse of the great Thar Desert on Trikuta
            Hill. It is today located along the southern edge of the city that bears its name; its dominant hilltop
            location making the sprawling towers of its fortifications visible for many miles around.

            In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Jaisalmer Fort,
            along with 5 other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the group Hill Forts
            of Rajasthan.

        <h2>#6:-KUMBHALGARH FORT:-</h2>
        <p>Kumbhalgarh (literally "Kumbhal fort") also known as the Great Wall of India is a Mewar fortress on the
            westerly range of Aravalli Hills, in the Rajsamand district near Udaipur of Rajasthan state in western
            India. It is the second-longest wall of the world after the Great Wall of China. It is a World Heritage
            Site included in Hill Forts of Rajasthan. It was built during the 15th century by Rana Kumbha.

            In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Kumbhalgarh Fort,
            along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the group Hill
            Forts of Rajasthan.

            The chief architect who built this fort was Mandan, who documented his style of work in his text,
            Rajvallabh. At the end, he dedicates the book to King Rana Kumbha.[citation needed]Kumbhalgarh also
            separated Mewar and Marwar from each other and was used as a place of refuge for the rulers of Mewar at
            times of danger. A notable instance was in the case of Prince Udai, the infant king of Mewar who was
            smuggled here in 1535, when Chittor was under siege. Prince Udai later succeeded to the throne. The fort
            remained impregnable to direct assault.

            Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat attacked the fort in 1457, but found the effort futile. There was a local belief
            then that the Banmata deity in the fort protected it and hence he destroyed the temple. There were further
            attempts in 1458–59 and 1467 by Mahmud Khalji, but it also proved futile. Akbar's general, Shahbaz Khan,
            attacked this fort in October 1577 and after the siege of 6 months, he was able to capture the fort in April
            1577. But it was recaptured by Pratap in 1578. In 1818, an armed band of sanyasis formed a garrison to
